# vwilight

A Vim clone of the famous TextMate Twilight theme, originally converted using
Coloration v0.3.2. Customized and tweaked for the best possible representation.

## History

When I originally switched from TexMate to Vim, I wanted to use the same color
scheme that I had gotten accutomed to, which was Twilight. However, all of the
vim Twilight ports that I found were very poor and didn't have the same look
and feel at all.

Then I came across [vwilight](https://gist.github.com/mojombo/796172), which
mojombo had ported directly from the TextMate theme. It was a huge step
forward, but certain elements still needed to be hand-tweaked to have the
proper look and feel, so I created a repository and the rest is history.
